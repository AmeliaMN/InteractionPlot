# InteractionPlot

These are some Shiny apps showing the possible effects of splitting a continuous numeric variable into a categorical variable and then using it in a linear model.

I have done two versions: one that only shows the app itself, https://github.com/AmeliaMN/InteractionPlot and one with additional exposition, https://ameliamn.shinyapps.io/InteractionPlotExplanation/InteractionPlot.Rmd
